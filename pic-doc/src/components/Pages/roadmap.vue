<p>We seek to include data that supports research relevant to furthering knowledge of critical care. PIC currently contains data such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Laboratory measurements from within the hospital</li>
<li>Charted observations during a patient’s stay in the intensive care unit</li>
<li>Vital signs recoded while a patient is present in the operating room (data point per 5 minute)</li>
<li>Structured symptoms extracted from notes regarding the patient's stay, including nursing notes, physician notes, discharge summaries and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope to supplement PIC with additional data in the future. We have particular interest in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Images corresponding to any medical imaging performed during the patient’s stay</li>
<li>Vital sign measurements made at the bedside</li>
<li>More structured information extracted from the notes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel that there are other areas of data which are critical to your study of interest and currently unavailable in the database, please let us know.</p>
